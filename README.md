This project demonstrates the use of Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming using separate producer and consumer scripts. It showcases a modular design for scalability and ease of maintenance.

## üöÄ Features

- Kafka Producer script to send messages to a topic.
- Multiple Consumer scripts, each consuming from specific topics or partitions.
- Environment-based configuration using `.env` or config files.
- Graceful error handling and reconnection logic.
- Logging for debugging and monitoring.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

- Java Spring Boot
- Apache Kafka running locally or on a remote server (Zookeeper as well)
- `kafka-python` or `confluent-kafka` library (depending on implementation)
